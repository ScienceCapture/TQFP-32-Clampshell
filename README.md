# TQFP-32-Clampshell
Clampshell is a device used for programming SMD packaged integrated circuits. It makes a connection to all the pins without the need for soldering. This particular design can program TQFP-32 IC packages and is designed for the ATMega328-P (Arduino MCU) chip. It has a USB-C connector for power, an integrated LED to run the blink sketch after programming and features an ISP connector for AVR programming (I used POLOLU-3172 AVR programmer). This PCB also provides access to all the 32 individual pins of the IC using pin headers. The clampshell module is QFP32-0.5-CP01N and it can be bought off the internet (I used AliExpress).
